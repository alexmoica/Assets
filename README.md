# **Assets**
Assets is a money management system for PC that dynamically tracks and plots multiple account balances. The goal of this project is to learn the basic and advanced features of the standard python graphics library, tkinter, and how to interface it with the matplotlib library.

### Getting Started
To use Assets, simply run the executable file in the directory. It will create 3 separate text files to keep track of balances, transactions, and note options as the program is used. To add or remove money from an account, select the account, write or choose a note, enter the amount, and click the plus button to add to the account or the minus button to remove from the account. By clicking the respective account balances you will get a live graph and history of deposits and withdrawals from the account.
