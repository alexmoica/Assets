# **Assets**
Assets is a account manager and grapher used to track and display Chequing, Credit, and Sacing account balances. The goal of this project is to learn the basic and advanced features of the standard python graphics library, tkinter, and how to interface it with the matplotlib library.

### Getting Started
To use Assets, place the python file and the icon in a directory and run the python program. It will create 4 separate text files to keep track of balances, transactions, and note options as the program is used. To add or remove money from an account, select the account, write or choose a note, enter the amount, and click the plus button to add to the account or the minus button to remove from the account.
